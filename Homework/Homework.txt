Some modular arithmetic
1. Working with the following set of Integers S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6} * són 7 números!
What is
a) 4 + 4 = 1 mod 7
b) 3 x 5 = 1 mod 7
c) what is the inverse of 3 ? 3^(-1) = 3^(p-2) = 3⁵ = 243 = 5 mod 7

2. For S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}
Can we consider 'S' and the operation '+' to be a group ? Yes it fallows all the group properties

3. What is
-13 mod 5 ?
	-13 ÷ 5 = -2 remainder -3
	The remainder is -3 because -13 is equivalent to -2 times 5 plus -3. 	However, when dealing with modular arithmetic, we only care about the 	remainder, not the quotient. Therefore, we can write:
	-13 mod 5 = -3
	However, we usually want to find the value of a mod b in the range 0 	to b-1, so we can use the fact that adding or subtracting a multiple 	of b 	to a doesn't change its remainder when divided by b. In this 	case, we can add 5 (which is a multiple of 5) to -3 to get:
	-3 + 5 = 2
	-13 mod 5 = 2 mod 5
	Therefore, -13 and 2 have the same remainder when divided by 5, so 	they are congruent modulo 5.

4. Polynomials
For the polynomial x³ – x² +4x -12
Find a the positive root ? x³ – x² +4x -12 = 0
	The constant term is -12, which has factors of ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±12.
	Therefore, any rational root of the polynomial must be of the form p/q, 	where p is a factor of ±12 and q is a factor of ±1. 
	x=1 → 1 -1 +4 -12 != 0 x=1 no root
	x=2 → 8 – 4 +8 -12 = 0
	There is a positive root in x=2 (x-2)(x²+3x+6)

What is the degree of this polynomial ? 3
